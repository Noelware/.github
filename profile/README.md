  <h4><i>Bridging open source and enterprise together with code at a time~</i></h4>
</div>

**Noelware, LLC.** is a company based in the United States created by [Noel Towa](https://floofy.dev) to help bridge open source and enterprise together with software (and possibly hardware in the future! :eyes:). Our flagship product is our cloud compute service, [Noel on the Cloud](https://noelware.cloud), which provides a bridge to unify cloud compute by making it possible to run a cloud service on your own premise or allow us to help you without having the constant problems of cloud providers like vendor lock in and more.
